# Restuarant-Management-System
Restaurant Management System written in C++. I conducted a lot of research on C++ and object-oriented programming when completing this project. I used my skills and knowledge gained to develop a program which allows users to create a restaurant with a set number of tables of different capacities. Then, the user can book, reserve, modify, and delete tables in the system.
